meVE.SticGlory.text = "Performing sacred service to your Master and Creator as a most lawful priest, you also became an emulator of his suffering, O godly-minded Charalambus. For you offered yourself as a pleasing sacrifice to him who offered himself as a sacrifice to the God and Father for your sake. Therefore, you rejoice with him in the heavenly tabernacles, in the Church of the firstborn; and you intercede with him unceasingly, for deliverance from wrath and distress for us who honor your all-festive memorial and with fervent longing venerate your head, which is a fountain of miracles that from afar saves us from outbreaks of pestilential disease and bestows healing on us."
