For though the PassionÂ­bearers were at first born on earth, they hastened to reach the angelic estate, and having despised their bodies, they were through sufferings deemed worthy of the honor of bodiless Angels. By their prayers, O Lord, send down on us your great mercy. "
ocVE.AposTheotokion.text = "Fearful, wondrous, and great is the mystery! He who is uncontainable was contained in a womb, and the Mother, after childbirth, still remained a Virgin.

ocVE.Stichera1.text = "Woe to me! I have provoked you to anger, my merciful God and Lord. How often have I promised to repent, O Christ, and was found to be a liar and a fool. Earlier I defiled the garment of my baptism and was heedless of my promises to you; and again, I have ignored that second profession which I made to you before Angels and men. Having clothed myself in the habit of mourning, I have despised it. O Savior, do not leave me henceforth to perish forever. "
ocVE.Stichera2.text = "What kind of defence will you make in the day of judgment, O wretched soul? Who will rescue you from the eternal fire and all the torments of damnation? No one, unless you become reconciled to the Compassionate one by abandoning your wicked conduct and acquiring a God-pleasing way of life, bewailing every day your countless faults by which you stumble every hour in deed and word and thought, and asking Christ to forgive you completely for these sins.

Now may I swiftly see your good will. Be quick and quench the flame of my passions, guiding me to the light of salvation and granting me deliverance from evils. "
ocVE.Stichera5.text = "The evil one had the same degree of glory as yourselves, O chief commanders. He rose with you like the morning star long ago, but through wickedness the adversary sank to earth and cloaked himself in darkness. He strives to destroy me with himself -- I who was honored with the image of the Fashioner. Yet though I was utterly fallen, Christ raised me up. So show yourselves my protectors, guardians, and wise helpers, asking for my wretched soul salvation and great mercy. "
ocVE.Stichera6.text = "Being made in God's image and numbered with you, O chief commanders, it behooved me never to bow down to the evil foe. But alas: because of the advice of the fiend, I did not emulate you but disobeyed the commandment and fell in the esteem of my Maker and was drawn down into slavery. But seeing me beset round about by passions, give me your hand and lead me to the highest path that I may attain to salvation, and ask for me the glory of the ancient beauty. "
