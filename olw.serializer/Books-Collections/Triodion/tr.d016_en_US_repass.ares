trVE.AposIdiomelon1.text = "Overtaken by greed, we underwent the primeval stripping, having yielded to the bitter tasting, and we became exiles from God. But let us turn back with repentance and purify the senses over which is our struggle, as we make an entrance to the fast, being confirmed in our hearts by the hope of grace and not by foods that are not fit for us in our walk. And the Lamb of God will be our food on the sacred and radiant night of the Resurrection, the Victim who for us was taken away, and of whom the Disciples partook the evening of the mystery, and who destroys the darkness of ignorance by the light of his Resurrection."
trVE.AposMartyric.text = "O Martyrs of the Lord, you hallow every place and heal every ill, and now we entreat you: Intercede that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the enemy."
trVE.AposTheotokion.text = "The heavenly beings hymn you, O full of grace, Mother without bridegroom. And as for us, we glorify your unsearchable conceiving. Intercede, O Theotokos, that our souls may be saved."
