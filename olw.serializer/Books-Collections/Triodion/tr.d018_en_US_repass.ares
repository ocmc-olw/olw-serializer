trMA.AposIdiomelon1.text = "Fasting from foods and not cleansing yourself from passions, my soul, you glory vainly in your abstinence. For unless your starting point is a desire to amend yourself, you will be despised as a liar in the sight of God, and will be like the wicked demons, who never eat. Therefore do not, by sinning, make your fast of no effect, but remain unswerving in the face of untoward attacks, having in mind to stand before the crucified Savior, or rather, to be crucified with him who was crucified for your sake, and cry out to him: Remember me, Lord, when you come in your kingdom."
trMA.AposMartyric.text = "O Martyrs worthy of all praise, neither distress nor confinement, nor hunger nor persecution, nor the lash, nor the wrath of wild beasts, nor sword nor threatening fire, were able to separate you from God. But rather, because of love for him, you struggled as though your bodies were not your own, forgetting nature and despising death. So you gained the deserved reward for your sufferings, becoming heirs of the Kingdom of the heavens. Ceaselessly intercede for our souls."
trMA.AposTheotokion.text = "When the blameless Virgin saw the Lamb fixed upon the Cross, she lamented and cried: My sweetest Child, what is this new and strange sight? How are  you, who hold all things in your grasp, nailed in the flesh to the Wood?"
trVE.AposIdiomelon1.text = "With great joy, O faithful, let us welcome the divinely-inspired proclamation of the Fast, as did the Ninevites before and as prostitutes and tax collectors welcomed the preaching of repentance by John. Through abstinence let us be prepared for participation in the Master's holy works in Sion.  Let us be cleansed through tears, in advance of the divine Washing there. Let us pray that we may see there the fufillment of the Pascha that was a type, and the manifestation of the true. Let us be made ready for the veneration of the Cross, and the Resurrection of Christ our God, crying to him, 'Do not put us to shame by depriving us of our expectation, O lover of man.'"
trVE.AposTheotokion.text = "When the spotless Virgin once saw on the Tree him to whom she had given birth from an unseeded womb, she could not bear the wound in her inmost depths, and in great distress she said, 'How is it that you who hold all creation in your command, are lifted on the Cross as one condemned? Truly you do this desiring to save mankind'."
