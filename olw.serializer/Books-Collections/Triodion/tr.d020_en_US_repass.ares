trMA.AposIdiomelon1.text = "Before the saving Cross, when sin reigned and impiety prevailed among men, bodily pleasure was deemed blessed, and few despised fleshly desires. But after the mystery of the Cross was accomplished,  and the tyranny of demons overcome by the knowledge of God, the virtue of the heavens was lived on earth. Therefore fasting is held in honor, abstinence shines, prayer is established, and the present season, which has been given to us by Christ our God who was crucified for the salvation of our souls, bears witness to this."
trMA.AposMartyric.text = "O Lord, all creation celebrates in remembrance of your Saints: the heavens rejoice with the Angels, and earth makes glad with men. By their invocations, have mercy on us."
trMA.AposTheotokion.text = "When the all-chaste Maiden saw you suspended on the Cross, she cried out with a mother's lament: My Son and my God, my sweetest Child, how do you bear this most shameful Passion?"
trVE.AposIdiomelon1.text = "The Cross of the Lord, to those who venerate it unwaveringly, is a bridle for every pleasure and a law of abstinence, because those who ceaselessly gaze on him who was fixed upon it, crucify the flesh with its passions and desires. Let us also flee from these through pure fasting, becoming reconciled to him who out of love for man became one with us through suffering, and imparted to us the character of his own dispassion, him who has great mercy."
trVE.AposMartyric.text = "The victorious Martyrs had no love for earthly enjoyment, and so they were counted worthy of heavenly good things, and became fellow-citizens with the Angels. O Lord, by their intercessions, have mercy on us and save us."
trVE.AposTheotokion.text = "When you saw suspended on the Tree, pure Maiden, the mature Cluster you had carried in the womb unhusbanded, lamenting, you groaned and cried, O little Child, let fall the drops of sweet new wine through which all the drunkenness of passions may be taken away, O Benefactor, for the sake of me who gave you birth, showing your compassion."
