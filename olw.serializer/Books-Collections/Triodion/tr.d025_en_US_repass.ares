trMA.AposMartyric.text = "O invincible Martyrs of Christ, having conquered error by the power of the Cross, you received the grace of eternal life. You did not fear the threats of tyrants; plagued by torments, you were rejoicing, and now your spilt blood has become healing for our souls. Intercede that our souls may be saved."

You, who hold all Creation together, are fastened to the wood, and you, who furnish life to all, are put to death, said the all-pure Theotokos weeping, when she saw on the Cross, the God and man who had shone from her ineffably."
trVE.AposIdiomelon1.text = "Let us accomplish a fast that is not only a renunciation of foods, but an estrangement from all material passion, that having before been enslaved to the flesh that tyrannizes over us, we may become worthy of the communion of the Lamb who was willingly slain for the world, the Son of God, and that we may celebrate the Savior's resurrection from the dead in a spiritual manner, being lifted up to the sublimity of virtues in the brilliance and delight of excellent works, gladdening the lover of man."
trVE.Stichera01.text = "Banished from Paradise because of the bitter tasting long ago, let us have faith that by abstinence from passions, we will become inhabitants there, crying out to our God: You who stretched out your palms on the Cross, drank vinegar and tasted gall and steadfastly endured the pain of the nails, dislodging from our souls the cruellest pleasures: in your compassionate mercy, save your servants."
trVE.Stichera02.text = "Removed far from Paradise long ago because of the eating from the tree, we were brought back in by your Cross, which we offer you in intercession, O many-mercied Lord. And with faith we all pray you: send down to us now, in the season of abstinence, fountains of tears to wash away all the filth of our passions and transgressions, that we may all cry fervently to you: O Lord, glory to you."
trVE.Stichera03.text = "Grant me freely, O Word, the delight of abstinence, as you once gave Paradise to Adam, that I may be given to taste of your every commandment, and to abstain always from the fruit you declared to be sin, O our God, that I may go forward in joy to your life-bearing Passion of the Cross."
